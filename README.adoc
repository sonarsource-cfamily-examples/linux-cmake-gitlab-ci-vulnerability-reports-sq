= C++ example project scanned on SonarQube using GitLab CI

It is very easy to analyze a C, C++ and Objective-C project with SonarQube https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/gitlab-integration/[on GitLab CI]:

. Create a `sonar-project.properties` file to store your configuration
. In your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:
.. Configure SonarQube server url (e.g.: https://example.com:9000)
.. As part of the `get-sonar-binaries` stage:
... Download the https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/[Sonar Scanner]
... Download the https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/analyzing-source-code/languages/c-family/prerequisites/#using-buildwrapper[Build Wrapper] from SonarQube server
... Push both binaries to cache, so they can be used in next step
.. As part of the `build` stage: 
... Install cmake package
... Pull Sonar Scanner and Build Wrapper from cache
... Wrap your compilation with the Build Wrapper
... Push Sonar Scanner and build Wrapper output directory to the cache
.. As part of the `sonarqube-check` stage:
... Pull build wrapper output and Sonar Scanner from cache
... Run `sonar-scanner`, specifying:
+
--
** the property `sonar.cfamily.compile-commands` with, as its value, `bw-output/compile_commands.json`, if you are using SonarQube version 10.6 or later 
** the property `sonar.cfamily.build-wrapper-output`, with value `bw-output`, if you are using SonarQube version 10.5 or earlier, as build-wrapper did not generate a `compile_commands.json` file before SonarQube 10.6
--
+
Noting that `bw-output` is the build wrapper output directory that you pulled from cache.
.. As part of the `sonarqube-vulnerability-report` stage:
... Pull the vulnerability report resulting from the latest scan
... Make its content available to the GitLab CI via the file gl-sast-sonar-report.json
. Make sure that you have your token stored as a CI variable in your project (`SONAR_TOKEN`). You can https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/user-token/[generate and use] new tokens in SonarQube.


You can take a look at the link:sonar-project.properties[sonar-project.properties] and link:.gitlab-ci.yml[.gitlab-ci.yml] to see it in practice. Please be aware that the SonarQube server URL is not completed in this .gitlab-ci.yml example.

= Code Description

An example of a flawed C++ code. The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is meant to be compiled with different build systems using different CI pipelines on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is forked into other repositories in https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples[this collection] to add a specific build system, platform, and CI.
The downstream repositories are analyzed either with https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] or https://sonarcloud.io/[SonarCloud].
